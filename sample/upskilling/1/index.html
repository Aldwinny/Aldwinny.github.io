        <h3>Bachelor's Degree</h3>
        <p>I finished my <u>IT degree</u> at Technological Institute of the Philippines Q.C. It's around Cubao, if you're familiar with QC</p>
        <h3>Senior High School & High School</h3>
        <p>I finished SHS and HS at Quezon City Academy which is a school located near SM North.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact</b>: Their rules are strict as hell, I need monthly 3 by 4 white side wall cuts which is almost the same as the military with a little <b><i>PIZZAZZ!</i></b></p>
        <h3>Elementary School</h3>
        <p>I finished elementary at Sto nino parochial school, which is a catholic school. (They were infamous for that one issue that happened where a student was stopped from her talks during their graduation..)</p>
